## Introduction

Flask is a popular micro web framework for Python. It allows you to build web applications quickly and efficiently. Caddy is a modern web server that automatically handles HTTPS and is easy to configure. This repository will guide you through the steps needed to deploy a Flask application using Caddy on a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A VPS with a Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu is recommended).
- Basic knowledge of the command line.
- Python installed on your VPS (preferably Python 3.6 or higher).
- A domain name pointed to your VPS.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your VPS.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PawanIITM2021/caddy-flask.git
   cd caddy-flask
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install Flask and other required libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Flask Application**: Create your Flask application or modify the existing one in the `app.py` file.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Install Caddy**: Follow the official [Caddy installation guide](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) to install Caddy on your VPS.

2. **Create Caddyfile**: In the root of your project, create a file named `Caddyfile`. This file will contain the configuration for your Caddy server. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

   ```caddy
   yourdomain.com {
       reverse_proxy localhost:5000
       log {
           output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Flask Application**: Start your Flask application.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Start Caddy**: Run Caddy using the following command:

   ```bash
   caddy run --config Caddyfile
   ```

## Configuration

Adjust your `Caddyfile` as needed. Here are some common settings:

- **TLS Settings**: Caddy automatically manages TLS certificates for your domain.
- **Logging**: Configure logging to track access and errors.

### Example Caddyfile

```caddy
yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:5000
    tls {
        on_demand
    }
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
    }
}
```

## Using Cloudflare

If you want to use Cloudflare for DNS management and additional security, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up for Cloudflare**: Create an account on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

2. **Add Your Domain**: Follow the prompts to add your domain to Cloudflare.

3. **Update Nameservers**: Change your domain's nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare.

4. **Configure DNS Records**: Add an A record pointing to your VPS's IP address.

5. **Enable SSL**: In the Cloudflare dashboard, set SSL to "Full" or "Full (strict)" for secure connections.
